This webpage serves as an online portfolio and displays my web presence, background, skills, projects and contact information. 

### How to access

Deployed site can be found here:

## Technologies used

-   HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
-   Additional libraries/frameworks:
    - Bootstrap for styling and implementing functionalities with jQuery
    - Font Awesome for the icons
    - Animate on Scroll library for the fading animations

## Wins & Challenges

### Wins
-   Implemented a smooth scroll to section when links are clicked. On mobile view, the burger bar is also collapsed when a link is clicked
-   Added fading animation effects using the Animate on Scroll library
-   Used CSS keyframes to create a text spin effect on the image caption (on desktop)
-   Created a transparent navbar which becomes a solid colour on scroll
-   Successfully utilised Bootstrap for: styling of page, turning project cards into a carousel, creating collapsible divs using buttons

### Challenges

-   Difficulties with Bootstrap overriding CSS styles and positioning things in the intended places
-   Initial responsiveness issues with the card carousel

## Bugs

-   Image caption has a text spin animation desktop view, however the text that is supposed to animate does not show on the mobile view (note: I have now added a function to remove the image caption completely from mobile view)
-   Page is slow to fully render on the initial visit, most sections load fairly fast but the projects section takes a bit more time (although this shouldn't be an issue as it will have loaded by the time the user gets to that section)
